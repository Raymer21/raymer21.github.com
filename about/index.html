    <h1> Hello! I am Jaxson!

        I am a new streamer trying to start off fresh!                         
        
        I stream with cody_raves and smirkstudios!                              
        
        On this channel you will find me playing Among us, Splitgate and coding                         
        
        If you enjoy please follow as i might stream tommorow!                         
        
        How i want my carrer path to go....I want to go to highschool and take coding classes. I am going to most likely go to college and learn coding. I am planning to learn Csharp(game dev). If i am able to learn alot about that, then i will most likely stream professional coding. However if i do go pro. you will have to understand that for some code. it is/will be private. i will do this because i dont want others to be able to just steal from me! Also if i get really popular from a game i made i am <b>not</b> going to <b>share anything</b> about it. or any code. Also if a game i made gets popular i probaly wont stream as much. as sorry as i will be i will not be able to stream as i will most likely be busy on that game. And if a game i made did not get popular, then i will probaly stream it. as much as i love coding with all of you. if a game i made gets popular, then i am going to be very sorry because i will probaly be busy on it.
